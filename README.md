### Overview
Customize the content of the site by either uploading audio/image files to the [Assets Folder](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/tree/master/client/src/assets) or directly editting the [Configuration File](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/app/config.json).

After making desired changes, the site must be redeployed via the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) dashboard.

Changes with the company email address must be done via SendGrid, and then referenced in Heroku and GitHub.

---
### Updating Guide
- Always make sure that you are on the `dev` branch before making changes. This ensures that if you make any typos or change your mind, the `master` branch remains in its previous, stable state.
- Start making edits/uploading files as desired. There are only two places where you will likely be making changes:
    - [Assets Folder](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/tree/master/client/src/assets)
        - Contains image and audio files.
        - See [below](#Uploading-Files) for more details.
        
    - [Configuration File](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/app/config.json)
        - Contains settings for site content.
        - See [below](#Configuration-File) for more details.

- Once you're happy with your changes you will need to commit them. At the bottom of the file you are editing simply write a short, specific message that tells your future self what changes you've made. You will need to do this for each file you are editing/uploading.
- When you are done making changes it may be wise to test them out before officially deploying to the `master` branch. To do this, go to your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) dashboard and click on the 'Deploy' tab. At the bottom under 'Manual Deploys' select 'Dev' from the options. Then click 'Deploy'. This will build/compile your changes and serve up your site from the `dev` branch, which contains the pending changes you've made.
- Once you are happy with the result you will need to make it 'official'. From the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio) create a pull request and make sure the base branch is `master` and the compare branch is `dev`. Follow the steps to complete the merge. Now you can deploy the site following the previous step, only this time select the `master` branch.
- That's it!

### Uploading Files
Uploading files is pretty straightforward but there are a couple important things to remember:
- The [Assets Folder](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/tree/master/client/src/assets) contains 3 folders, all of which may be updated: 
    - [Audio](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/tree/master/client/src/assets/audio)
        - Contains `.mp3` files which are used by the site's audio player.
    - [Icons](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/tree/master/client/src/assets/icons) 
        - *Warning: Currently `sohn-logo.svg` is the only file that is customizeable. Any additional `.svg` files added here won't do anything.*
    - [Images](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/tree/master/client/src/assets/images)
        - Every image on the site reads from this location. Any file (with a few exceptions listed later below) can be added here and referenced in the [Configuration File](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/app/config.json).
- Use a consistent naming convention. I recommend `lowercase` with `hyphens` (e.g. example-file.png).
- All image files (except for icons) should be `.png` and all audio files should be `.mp3`.
- There are several files that are not referenced in the [Configuration File](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/app/config.json) because they are simply harded code into the site:
    - [assets/icons/sohn-logo.svg](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/assets/icons/sohn-logo.svg)
    - [assets/images/sohn-wallpaper.png](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/assets/images/sohn-wallpaper.png)
    - [assets/images/sohn-headshot.png](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/assets/images/sohn-headshot.png)
    
     You are welcome to replace a file from this list, but if you do, just make sure to retain the same filename. Otherwise the site will not be able to find it.

### Configuration File
The [Configuration File](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/app/config.json) contains all the settings/metadata you need for customizing site content. You can reference new audio tracks and images that you've uploaded, edit page titles, and customize labels and subtitles.

### SendGrid
This site uses [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) to send emails to your account. If you decide in the future to change your email there are a couple steps you'll have to perform:
- Register the new address in your SendGrid account.
- Ensure that you still have a valid sendgrid API key. You can find these listed in your SendGrid account.
- From [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), under the Settings tab, open the 'Config Vars' section. You'll need to update the `EMAIL` configuration variable to the new email address.
- Check that the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` configuration variable matches the one registered to your SendGrid account. If not you'll have to update it.
- Update the email address property in the "contactPage" section of the [Configuration File](https://github.com/sohncompositions/sohn-compositions-portfolio/blob/master/client/src/app/config.json).
